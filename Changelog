Firmware Release 03.03.10 (99)
System:
[NEW]   The switch mode on 4-port PFC devices (750-8215) may now be configured
    like 2-port devices for ports X1 & X2 via WBM.
    The default switch configuration on 750-8215 has changed from a fixed
    separated to an all switched setting.
    It is now possible to configure all 4 ports, as you like via config-tool.
    Our next release will make this feature available via WBM.
[NEW]   By download of the CDS3 PROFINET i-Device functionality, the 
    PROFINET-designated ports X11 & X12 are automatically combined in one bridge.
[FIXED] Cloud-Connectivity: Improve robustness of Azure IoT hub connection
    when using an unreliable network connection.
[FIXED] Correct impact of SMS method calls and modem status requests from
    Codesys IEC application to modem data service for PFC 750-8207

Runtime System:
[FIXED] Correct directory handling in e!Cockpit SysDirLinux library for PFC

Fieldbus Interface & Protocols:
 - Profibus
   [FIXED] Correct mapping of PROFIBUS Bool variables for PFC. Possible wrong 
           configuration of Bool arrays is now blocked in the
           CODESYS 2.3 PROFIBUS configurator (requires new TSP).
